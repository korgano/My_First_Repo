            <img src="../image/Intel-Arc1.jpg" alt="Intel Arc Reference Design Render" class="block">
            <p>To the disappointment of everyone, Intel's new Arc graphics cards are now expected to release in Q2 2022. Website Moore's Law is Dead released a new set of leaks that covered the projected release date, plus a render of the reference model. The delay is reported to be due to supply chain issues, not drivers.</p>
            <p>Everyone who's been waiting for a GPU since the current shortage nightmare has begun now has a new worry. Q2 2022 puts it close to the expected Q3 release for AMD and Nvidia's new cards, making fear of missing out and other buyer's remorse extra potent.</p>
